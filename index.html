        <p id="uc">Been at a pause at playing kenshi because i was so burned out. I'm back on the grind though and i made significant progress. I kidnapped the emperor from the united cities' second in command to give to the anti slavers as a gift and we're allies now, i've also kidnapped a few other nobles not long after that so 3 cities are now sovereignless.</p>
